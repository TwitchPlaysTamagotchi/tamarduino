Arduino sketch to control the robotic finger

The Arduino controls two servos for the robotic finger, but also controls the Tamagotchi according to button presses. The buttons could have been wired directly to the Tamagotchi but they would have needed an inverter gate, as the buttons are normally closed, and those of a Tamagotchi are normally open. The Arduino acts as an inverter gate.
